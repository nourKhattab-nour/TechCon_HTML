            <img src="images/techcon-history.jpg" alt="Group photo from the first TechCon in 2010" width="600">
            <p>Founded in 2010, TechCon began as a small gathering of 200 tech enthusiasts in a university auditorium. Over the past 14 years, we've grown into one of the world's premier technology conferences, hosting over 10,000 attendees annually. Our journey reflects the evolution of the tech industry itself, from early discussions about cloud computing to today's focus on AI and quantum computing.</p>
            <p>Each year, we've expanded our horizons while maintaining the collaborative spirit that marked our beginnings. TechCon 2024 marks our 15th anniversary celebration, where we'll honor our roots while exploring the future.</p>
